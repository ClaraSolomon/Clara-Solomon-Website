<dd>Feel a little overwhelmed? Don't worry my mom and I did too at the beginning. Taking the first step can be very scary, especially when you have <strong style="color: #9665cf">NEVER</strong> taught before. It all comes down to your concerns about your student. What is your student struggling with? Is it a certain subject or do they have a different learning style? Is your student falling behind in their grades? What is their environment like at school? What's their home life like? Do they get overwhelmed with their school work? These are just a few of the questions that need to be answered to provide a successful learning experience for your student.

<p>This is the exact day; My first day being a homeschool student. You would have thought my mom and I didn't prepare at all! The first curriculum we chose was <strong style="color: #9665cf">WAY</strong> too hard. The math was very complex and worse...there were no pictures in the textbook. Fast forward a month and a brand new curriculum....that also didn't work for my learning style. In the end we stumbled upon a curriculum called "Time 4 Learning." The curriculum wasn't overly complex while still making me think. It also provided video tutorials of how to solve an educational problem and the best part..IT HAD PICTURES!
