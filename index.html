<h3>Violinist</h3>
<img id="me" src="me.jpeg" alt="Clara With Violin" align="right">
<blockquote>
I have played the violin for over 7 years. I started playing the violin in 6th grade when I was around 12 years old. I remember watching commercials that had orchestral music in the background, and I knew that I wanted to be a violinist. My first few years in orchestra at my previous middle school were very slow, but after those years we had our first few successful orchestra concerts! Fast-forward 5 years, multiple awards, and many concerts I can say the love and passion I have for the violin is still strong.
</blockquote>

<h3>Education</h3>
<blockquote>
I was in public school for the majority of my life from Pre-K all the way to the last day of school in 8th grade. However, during my 8th grade year, my Mother and I realized that my learning style was different from the public school systems teaching style. Furthermore, we decided to take me out of the public school system and start homeschooling me. Now there was a rocky start to my 9th grade year as a new homeschool. My mom had to find a curriculum that worked for me while balancing my socialization but in the end everything worked out. I had a homeschool prom at a public homeschool organization, I played tennis, excelled in my violin playing, enrolled in cake decorating classes, game designing classes, art classes, and during my high school years I went to college early and got my associates degree in art at Temple College! <a href="https://www.templejc.edu/live/news/588-dual-credit-program-helps-home-schooled-student"> Here I am on the Temple College website</a>.
